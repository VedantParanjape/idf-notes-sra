# Kconfig

[advanced usage guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.14.0/guides/kconfig/index.html)
* menuconfig is a old system used by linux for configuration
* on running idf.py menuconfig, you see a menu, all the entries in it are generated by file Kconfig.
* Kconfig defines the entries of the menu

* Kconfig starts and ends with `menu` and `endmenu` it is must to see the it in menu
```
menu

endmenu
```

three data types only: 
* int
* string
* bool

we use `config` to configure a value
```
config MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE
    int "Queue Size"
    default 1000
    help 
        "Sets message queue size"
```

* So, all the values set by menuconfig are stored in a header file called sdkconfig.h, options are stored in sdkconfig file.
* So, if my config option is `MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE`, we can use this value by using macro named `CONFIG_MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE`
* All the config values are stored in form of a macro, and can be accessed by prefixing `CONFIG_` with the name of the config value.
